## Chrome Refresh 2023

The Chrome Refresh 2023, also known as CR23, was a visual and functional update to the Google Chrome web browser that began rolling out in September 2023. The update introduced a number of changes, including:
  * A new look inspired by Material You: Chrome adopted the Material You design language, which is also used in Android and ChromeOS. This means that Chrome now has a more modern and streamlined look, with rounded corners softer colors, and larger buttons.
  * An improved address bar: The address bar in Chrome was redesigned to be more informative and easier to use. The new address bar includes buttons for sharing, site information, and history, as well as a larger search field. 
  * A revamped main menu: The main menu in Chrome was also redesigned to be more intuitive and easier to navigate. The new menu includes new icons for easier navigation and a dedicated menu for managing tabs, now located on the left side. 
  * New features: In addition to the visual changes, CR23 also introduced a number of new features, such as tab groups, which allow you to group related tabs together, and live captions, which automatically generate captions for videos that are playing in Chrome.

The Chrome Refresh 2023 was a significant update to the Google Chrome web browser. The new look and features make Chrome more modern, user-friendly, and efficient.

The update was not without its critics, however. Some users complained that the new design was too bland or that the new features were not useful. However, overall, the Chrome Refresh 2023 was well-received by users and critics alike.

It is important to note that the Chrome Refresh 2023 was not a mandatory update. Users could choose to opt out of the update if they did not want to use the new features. However, Google has said that it will eventually roll out the update to all Chrome users.

## Information

As we know, these flags experiments are only temporary. Because it can be assured that Google will remove these flags experiments in the future version of Google Chrome, and we are required to use the new Google Chrome interface. And we won't be able to do anything.
